The state is the location of the ball. The value of a state is the negative of
the number of strokes to the hole from that location. Our actions are how we aim
and swing at the ball, of course, and which club we select. Let us take the
former as given and consider just the choice of club, which we assume is either
a putter or a driver. The upper part of Figure shows a possible state-value
function, $v_{\text{putt}} (s)$, for the policy that always uses the putter.

# Outline {.unnumbered}

The textbook for chapter one is Bertsekas' book [@Bertsekas2005]. Chapters 2 and 3 are adapted from Sutton's book [Ch. 3, Ch. 4, @Sutton2018]. For application and broad connection with more machine learning applications, we refer to [@Brunton2019]. Also, we recommend a handbook of algorithms [@Szepesvari2022]. For applications with implemented code, we follow the books [@Bilgin2020].
